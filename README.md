# Hi, I'm Jon Short and this is my website

This is the public repo for [my website](http://jonshort.me/), which is built in React.

## What's the current state of this repo?

This is extremely old at this point, still using create-react-app. It could do with migrating over to a more modern stack at some point...

## Hosting

Currently hosted as a static site on a VPS using [caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) - frontend by cloudflare

## Installation

To run this locally:

- `git clone` it somewhere
- Run `yarn` or `npm install`
- Run `npm start`
- That's it!

## Anything else?

This repo is mainly for me to have some source-control over the site, but feel free to look around at how I've done things.
