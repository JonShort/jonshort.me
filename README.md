# Hi, I'm Jon Short and this is my website
This is the public repo for [my website](http://jonshort.me/), which is built in React.

## Installation
To run this locally:

- `git clone` it somewhere
- Run `yarn` or `npm install`
- Run `npm start`
- That's it!

## Anything else?
This repo is mainly for me to have some source-control over the site, but feel free to look around at how I've done things.
