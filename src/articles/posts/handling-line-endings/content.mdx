[Line endings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline) can be extremely annoying when sharing code between mac / linux / windows.

Each operating system handles line endings differently, with the two main 'end of line' (EOL) types being:

- `CRLF` (windows)
- `LF` (unix / mac)

### What are line endings?

A hangover of ASCII code being developed in the 1960s, `CRLF` actually represents two instructions, 'carriage return' (CR) and 'line feed' (LF). 

If we imagine a typewriter, `CR` instructs the 'carriage' (the part which horizontally positions the paper) to return to its starting position, then `LF` feeds paper into the carriage, creating a newline.

### The codes behind line endings

Imagine we access a windows machine and create a text file with the following content:

```txt
a

b

c
```

If we were to look at the ASCII behind the file, it'd look something like:

```ASCII
61 0D 0A 0D 0A 62 0D 0A 0D 0A 63
```

<small>note - I chose hex because it's a bit more compact than the raw binary</small>

However if we had created our text file on a mac, it might instead look like:

```ASCII
61 0A 0A 62 0A 0A 63
```

Here's what each hex represents:
- `61` - a
- `62` - b
- `63` - c
- `0D` - CR
- `0A` - LF 

Notice that wherever there is a line break, windows includes `0D 0A` (CR LF) whereas mac includes only `0A` (LF).

Reading & writing text files with different line endings might have led to issues in the past, but nowadays most programs / operating systems handle it gracefully, so users don't have to worry about which EOL style was used.

It's usually when we involve source control that the problems start to appear.

### A real-life scenario

Let's run through a scenario (with a link to where this happened to me ðŸ˜…):

1. We fork a repository to fix a bug that has been reported
1. Our first commit goes in, where we edited a few lines in one file
1. We continue making changes, eventually we've made changes in 3 different files
1. [We submit the PR, and notice the diff is unreadable!](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer/pull/83/files/e6d4f1ec6039205cdae494ddbc1da3138e7a2a2b#diff-46e096273c34574c69c78c6fe33ac032)

Git is showing us that every single line in the file has changed, but it isn't highlighting a specific area! It turns out that we've accidentally changed all the line endings in each file we edited.

In our scenario:
* The repository didn't include a `.gitattributes` file
* The repository used `CRLF` line endings (this was surprising)
* I was working on macOS with `core.autocrlf` set to "input" globally

### gitattributes

The `.gitattributes` file handles a few different things, but the most common use is to tell git how to handle line endings for different filetypes.

They range in complexity, from a simple:

```yml
# Handle line endings automatically
# for files detected as text
# and leave all files detected
# as binary untouched.
* text=auto
```

To something more bespoke:

```yml
# Set the default behavior,
# in case people don't have
# core.autocrlf set.
* text=auto

# Explicitly declare text files you
# want to always be converted
# to native line endings on checkout.
*.c text
*.h text

# Declare files that will always
# have CRLF line endings on checkout.
*.sln text eol=crlf

# Denote all files that are truly
# binary and should not be modified.
*.png binary
*.jpg binary
```

The flags above show:
* `binary` - don't process this file for line endings
* `text` - process this file for line endings
* `eol` - convert all line endings to this style 

### core.autocrlf

The `core.autocrlf` setting controls how git handles line endings on checkout and on commit.

There are three options that can be used:
* true
* input
* false

The `true` option will convert the line endings to `CRLF` when checked out, but ensure line endings are `LF` on commit.

The `input` option won't change line endings on checkout, but will ensure that files are `LF` on commit.

The `false` option will disable any conversion, allowing `CRLF` line endings to be committed.

It's worth noting that these 'generic' options are overridden by the `.gitattributes` file, which is why it's usually a good idea to include one of these files if you're working on a project with developers who use a mixture of operating systems.

### What's the best configuration?

Generally git reccomends text files use `LF` line endings when committed to source control. Because of this, the best 'default' option for `core.autocrlf` varies depending on the OS:

* **Windows** reccomends **true**, which gives you `CRLF` locally, but `LF` in source control
* **Unix / MacOS** reccomends **input**, which ensures that code is `LF` when checked in, but doesn't convert on checkout

### How can we set the config?

It's often useful to setup a global git configuration, so that we have some reasonable defaults when working in new repositories.

Then when a repository needs bespoke settings, we can set a local config which will only be used for that particular repo.

Here are some examples:

_Check the current global git config_
```bash
git config --global --list
```

_Set the global autocrlf config to input_
```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf input
```

_Check the autocrlf config which will be used for the current repo_
```bash
git config --get core.autocrlf
```

_Set the local repo config to false_
```bash
git config --local core.autocrlf false
```

### Summary

I hope you've found something useful in this article; most of this information has come from me having to deal with line endings issues, but the ASCII information I read in Charles Petzold's excellent book [CODE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code:_The_Hidden_Language_of_Computer_Hardware_and_Software).

The general best practice to line endings would be:

1. Set up a gitattributes file in all shared repositories
1. Set autocrlf globally to the git reccomendation
1. If a repo uses CRLF exclusively, locally set your autocrlf value to false

### Extra!

Recently I've seen that [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) includes an [end-of-line](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html#end-of-line) config option. This might be a nice way to help reduce the amount of erroneous line endings that get included in shared projects, so is probably worth setting if using prettier on a project.

This prettier option is also useful if you need to change the line-endings for a particular file; set it to what you need, and format the file!

Thanks for reading ðŸ¥³
